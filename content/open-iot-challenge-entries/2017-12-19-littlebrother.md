“little brother” runs in two language VM’s on the Raspberry PI. The first, Pharo, I’ve discussed at some length. The second I haven’t, partly because it’s better known, but partly because the use case has become clearer during development.  It is the Java VM, specifically used with OSGi in the form of Eclipse Kura.
