We introduce YAKS which is actually not « Yet Another Key-value Store » per se, but a framework offering a unified view similar to a key-value store of distributed and heterogeneous data storages. A YAKS infrastructure allows the deployment of various data storages at any point of the system (cloud, edge or in the devices themselves) and to query or subscribe to the data from any point of the system in a location-transparent way. YAKS is the data distribution technology used by the Eclipse Fog05 project.
