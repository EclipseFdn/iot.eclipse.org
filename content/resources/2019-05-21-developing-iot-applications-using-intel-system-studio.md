Intel® System Studio is based on the Eclipse CDT project and offers a comprehensive set of tools under a free and renewable licensing model. This software suite allows you to build, debug, analyze and optimize applications and can be used throughout the entire development cycle from hardware bring-up to deploying the final product. During this presentation, we will introduce you to Intel® System Studio and show how to develop and debug IoT and systems applications. This includes running them locally and remotely on popular Intel Developer Kit platforms like the Aaeon UP2 and IEI Tank, as well as enhancing applications through cloud connectors, sensors, and libraries.
