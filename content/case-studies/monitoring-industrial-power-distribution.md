    The business application: building virtual power plants
        </h2>
        <p>E.ON Connecting Energies is a business unit of E.ON and 
        an international provider of integrated energy solutions 
        for commercial and industrial customers as well as public-
        sector  institutions.  E.ON  is  an  international  privately-
        owned  energy  supplier  and  will  in  future  be  focusing  
        entirely  on  renewables,  energy  networks  and  customer  
        solutions. In the 2014 financial year, more than 58,000 
        employees based in many countries in Europe as well as 
        in Russia and North America generated sales of around 
        EUR 112 billion. Around 33 million customers purchase 
        gas and electricity from E.ON. 
        </p>
        <p>E.ON  Connecting  Energies  is  headquartered  in  Essen,  
        Germany,  and  exploits  innovative  technology  such  as  
        machine-to-machine communication and data analytics 
        to  provide  integrated  energy  solutions  with  tangible  
        cost  benefits  for  customers.  As  a  system  integrator, 
        E.ON  Connecting  Energies  is  technology  agnostic  and  
        vendor-independent, allowing them to leverage cutting-
        edge  technology  to  develop  the  best  possible  solution  
        for  customers.  Three  years  ago  the  company  entered  
        the  Virtual  Power  Plant  (VPP)  space,  whereby  they  help  
        companies offer and monetize their capacities beyond 
        their own needs to contribute to the energy system. 
        </p>
        <p>
        E·ON Connecting Energies analyzes customer equipment 
        resources including on-site power generation units (e. g. 
        diesel generators, wind, PV , biomass, etc.) and transforms 
        their  capacities  into  VPPs,  meaning  they  can  control  
        these sources by a central control system optimized to 
        access data 24/7. Eventually, they sell the excess energy 
        and capacity for the customer into the energy markets, 
        such  as  wholesale  markets  (e.g.  spot,  intraday),  reserve  
        markets  (primary,  secondary,  tertiary  reserve)  or  local  
        optimisation  (e.g.  peak  charge,  avoidance,  imbalance  
        optimisation).

The Industrial Control System - Eclipse SCADA
</h2>

<p>E.ON Connecting Energies found a solution in the Eclipse SCADA project, an open source supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) communication system that operates with coded signals over communication channels to provide control of remote equipment. </p>

<p>SCADA systems historically distinguish themselves from other industrial control systems by being large scale processes that can include multiple sites, and large distances. Eclipse SCADA was attractive to E.ON Connecting Energies because they wanted to remain vendor-neutral and liked the flexibility of an open source project.</p>

<p>“We wanted a SCADA system we could use with access to some of the developers, which gives us the flexibility to adjust the system to our needs and grow over time,” says Doug Taylor, Head of Process IT, E.ON Connecting Energies. “We went with Eclipse SCADA because it gave us a ready made control system as an open source product.”</p>

<p>E.ON Connecting Energies developed a VPP system to reach remote machines and pull data through a communication box that bridges a network and a secure gateway. The data is brought through a cellular network to the data center, and goes through Eclipse SCADA to do the remote command and control of the units.</p>

<p>The VPP has two engines – one that virtualizes the unit in the field, and the VPP engine that takes the flexibility and optimizes it and presents it to grid operators. Eclipse SCADA abstracts the various power generation units so they can talk to the VPP. With Eclipse SCADA, E.ON Connecting Energies helps customers integrate their hardware with their VPP business application for data acquisition, monitoring, data and event archival, visualization and value processing. </p>

<p>The flexibility of Eclipse SCADA allows the E.ON Connecting Energies VPP to turn remote equipment on or off on demand. They take that control and calculate how much power can be made or consumed, and then sell extra power as a product pack to the grid. Instead of seeing hundreds of individual power units, the grid sees them as one very large unit. </p>

<p>E.ON Connecting Energies and the digital development team is growing fast, and for that reason they need a flexible and agile environment and infrastructure. The open source character of the system strongly contributed to this environment. IBH helped create the Eclipse SCADA project and actively participate in the ongoing open source development. IBH worked closely with E.ON Connecting Energies to install Eclipse SCADA and customize it to meet their needs.</p>
