Edgeworx, the creators of Eclipse ioFog, delivers an edge application platform providing developers a standardized way to develop and remotely deploy secure microservices for the edge.

Key features of ioFog Engine:

Intelligence - Provides an Edge Compute Platform enabling any hardware to run any software, creating an intelligent edge node.
Connected - Makes it easy to create a dynamic, distributed, self-organizing Edge Compute Network (ECN) with all your devices at the edge.
Secure - Pure Edge Security designed for the edge, where each node is a member of a distributed trust network that secures your edge.

Edgeworx enables you to bring your own edge.
