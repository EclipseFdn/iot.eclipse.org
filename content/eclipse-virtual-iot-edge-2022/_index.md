Virtual IoT and Edge Days 2022 is an online event for IoT and Edge developers, with an emphasis on Eclipse-driven projects and technologies. The aim of the event is to gather our contributors and committers to share information that encourages collaboration among the various projects.

The event is open to any developer, product manager or architect interested in IoT and Edge topics. It is hosted jointly by the Eclipse IoT, Edge Native, and Sparkplug working groups at the Eclipse Foundation.

Please help drive the conversation and build momentum around IoT and Edge innovation by proposing a talk! To learn more and submit your talk, visit the [Call for Proposals page](/eclipse-virtual-iot-edge-2022/call-for-proposals).

IoT & Edge Days 2022 is hosted by the Eclipse IoT, Edge Native, and Sparkplug working groups at the Eclipse Foundation.
