You do not need to be a chief architect or long-time industry pundit to submit a proposal; in fact, we strongly encourage first-time speakers to submit talks and engage with the Eclipse IoT and Edge community. We will continue to work with partners at the working groups and potential sponsors to help keep IoT & Edge days professional, welcoming, and friendly.
