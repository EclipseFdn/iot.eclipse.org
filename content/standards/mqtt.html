<p>
  <strong>MQTT</strong> is a
  <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-mqtt/index.html" target="_blank">protocol designed</a> to connect the physical world devices and networks, with applications and middleware used in IT and Web development, making it an ideal connectivity protocol for IoT and M2M.
</p>
<p>It is a lightweight publish-subscribe protocol that runs on embedded devices and mobile platforms, while connecting to highly scalable enterprise and web servers over wired and wireless networks. It is useful for connections with remote embedded systems where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium or connectivity unpredictable, and, for mobile applications that require small size, low power usage, minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers.</p>
<p>With loose coupling and quality-of-service, MQTT is optimized for dynamic system environments where high volumes of physical world messages and events need to be made available to Web and enterprise servers, and other consumers. MQTT has been well positioned for even the unanticipated requirements of M2M and IoT applications.</p>

<p>
  The
  <a href="https://eclipse.org/paho" target="_blank">Eclipse Paho projec</a>t is based around MQTT client runtimes that implement the MQTT messaging protocol. The client runtimes can be configured to run against a broker running on your server, or the sandbox MQTT server described below. There are
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Paho#Quick_Start_Guides" target="_blank">Quick Start Guides</a> available to get started. This article
  <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/practical-mqtt-with-paho">Practical MQTT with Eclipse Paho</a> is also a good introduction to MQTT.
