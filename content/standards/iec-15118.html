<p>
  The international standard <strong>ISO/IEC 15118</strong>, entitled "Road vehicles - Vehicle to grid communication interface", defines a digital IP-based communication interface between an electric vehicle (EV) and a charging station (named Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment - EVSE).
</p>
<p>
  It allows for a user-friendly "plug-and-charge" mechanism for authentication, authorization, billing, and flexible load control based on a wide set of information exchanged between the EV and EVSE.
