Edge Computing World is a brand new conference which will run December 9-12 2019 at the Computing History Museum in Silicon Valley. Edge Computing is a strategic focus area for the Eclipse Foundation, and we are proud to support this exciting new event.

The Eclipse Foundation already hosts two innovative projects that have been built from the ground up to address the challenges of edge computing: Eclipse fog05 and Eclipse ioFog. fog05’s approach is to create a unified compute fabric that spans across things, edge nodes and the Cloud. ioFog, on the other hand, creates a distributed Edge Compute Network (ECN) where you can deploy and run microservices.

If you wish to learn more about ioFog, fog05 and the rest of the edge computing ecosystem please attend Frédéric Desbiens' session at the conference, You can register here and save 10% by using the ECLIPSE10 registration code.

Please help us build the open source edge computing ecosystem. See you at the conference!
