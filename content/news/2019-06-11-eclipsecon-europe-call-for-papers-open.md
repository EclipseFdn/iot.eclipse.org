EclipseCon Europe is the leading conference for developers, architects, and open source business leaders to learn about Eclipse technologies, share best practices, and more. Taking in place in Ludwigsburg, Germany, October 21-24, 2019, ECE 2019 is our biggest event of the year and connects the Eclipse ecosystem and the industryâ€™s leading minds under one roof. We are pleased to once again co-locate with the OSGi Alliance Community Event, adding more breadth and expertise to the program.

The ECE 2019 Call for Papers is now open. Please visit the CFP page for information on how to submit your talk. This year, the early-bird submission deadline is July 1 and the final submission deadline is July 15.
