Eclipse VOLTTRON provides an environment for agent execution and serves as a single point of contact for interfacing with devices (rooftop units, building systems, meters, etc.), external resources, and platform services such as data archival and retrieval. VOLTTRON applications are referred to as agents since VOLTTRON provides an agent-based programming paradigm to ease application development and minimize the lines of code that need to be written by domain experts such as buildings engineers. Eclipse VOLTTRON provides a collection of utility and helper classes that simplifies agent development.
