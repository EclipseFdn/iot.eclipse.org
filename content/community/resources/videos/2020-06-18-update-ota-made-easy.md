For each (I)IoT solution, it is important to have an update path set in place. One reason is of course security but usually these solutions evolve so you also need to ship feature updates to your clients "over the air". Eclipse hawkBitâ„¢ provides a full backend system for update and release management including conditional updates based on attributes for each device like a version or operating system and allows to define rollout campaings that are especially important if a large set of devices should be updated.
