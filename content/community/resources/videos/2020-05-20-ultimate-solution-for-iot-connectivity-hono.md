Eclipse Hono Co-Project Lead Kai Hudalla presents the Eclipse Hono project and its goals. Hono basically solves a problem, namely that different devices should be able to communicate with a uniform backend via different protocols. For this purpose, Hono offers interfaces on all common (I)IoT protocols and merges them into one communication channel, namely AMQP. Hono takes care of all necessary steps, from uniform authentication and authorization to the mapping of messages.
