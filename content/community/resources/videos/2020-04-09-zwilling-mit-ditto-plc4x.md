In this video, we present the Eclipse Ditto Project. Our co-host is Thomas JÃ¤ckle (Projekt Lead Eclipse Ditto). Ditto is an open source project that makes it easy to create Digital Twins. We go through a practical example and extend it a bit to show you how fast you can set up a twin of a controller with Ditto and PLC4X.
