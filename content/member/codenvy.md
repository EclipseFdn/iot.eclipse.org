Eclipse Che provides an open source developer workspace server and cloud IDE that can be used with IoT platforms leveraging any language - from C/C++ to Java, JavaScript, Python and others. Che's unique architecture allows it to be used locally or in the cloud at <a href="https://codenvy.io/">codenvy.io</a>.
Organizations productizing IoT can white label Eclipse Che, or create an IoT focused multi-tenant cloud IDE derived from Codenvy's on-premises offering. For more information contact <a href="mailto:info@codenvy.com target="_top">info@codenvy.com</a>.
