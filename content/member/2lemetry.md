2lemetry is an IoT platform and solutions company that powers the connected enterprise, tying people, processes, data and devices togetherâ€”transforming raw data into real-time actionable intelligence.

2lemetry's ThingFabric platform acts as an IoT version of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) middleware solutions, providing device connectivity at scale, cross-communication, data brokering and storage. We also help companies make sense of the captured data by offering actionable data intelligence through predictive computational models and a configurable rules engine.
The ThingFabric platform has a unique protocol-agnostic architecture that enables native support of multiple protocols (like MQTT, CoAP, STOMP, and M3DA), even allowing the customer to upload their own homegrown, proprietary or legacy protocols.

2lemetry actively contributes to the Paho project around objective-c and MQTT.
