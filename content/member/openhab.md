openHAB UG (haftungsbeschr√§nkt) is the company behind the open-source home automation solution openHAB and believes that an open-source stack is the only right answer for home gateways. openHAB UG therefore initiated the Eclipse SmartHome project and is the lead developer behind it.

The Eclipse SmartHome project is a framework that allows building smart home solutions that have a strong focus on heterogeneous environments, i.e. solutions that deal with the integration of different protocols or standards. Its purpose is to provide a uniform access to devices and information and to facilitate different kinds of interactions with them.
