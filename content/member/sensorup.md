Data from all your different sensors, accessible in a single platform

SensorUp makes information from all different kinds of sensors accessible in a single platform, by using open standards to connect the sensors. Our IoT Platform is the world's first, most complete, compliant implementation of the OGC SensorThings API.

SensorThings API was purpose-built for IoT, and manages low power, low bandwidth, and intermittent connectivity situations. The standard isREST-based and JSON encoded,so it's developer friendly. Our easy-to-use APIs and SDKs can be understood and worked with in very little time.
