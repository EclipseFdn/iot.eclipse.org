Canonical is the company behind Ubuntu, the leading Operating System for cloud and Internet of Things. Most public cloud workloads are running on Ubuntu, as do smart gateways, self-driving cars and advanced robots. Canonical has been a proponent of open source since 2004, committed to creating it, refining it, certifying it for reliability and promoting its use. 
 
Canonical leads the development of the snap universal Linux packaging system for secure, transactional device updates and app stores. Ubuntu Core is an all-snap OS, perfect for devices and appliances. Canonical is a privately held company with presence in over 30 countries, providing enterprises with products, support and consultancy for their cloud, IoT and developer desktop deployment.
