Generative Software is an Eclipse Solution Member since 2011 and joined the Working Group in summer 2015. It aims to provide DSLs, a canonical IoT meta model and Open-Source code generators that target the Eclipse IoT components and projects. This allows you to design and develop complete IoT solutions in a model-driven way, do rapid prototyping and keep track of the solution’s system and software architecture. At the same time, the Virtual Developer Platform serves as a central place, where many different IoT related generators can be found and all of them are accessed in a uniform way, without installation on a developer’s computer, no matter who develops or owns a generator (device manufacturer, platform vendor, solution developer, …).
