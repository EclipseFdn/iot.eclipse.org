The **Eclipse Open IoT Testbeds** are an initiative of the Eclipse IoT Working Group. The testbeds focus on demonstrating
how open source, open standards along with commercial solutions can be used to create real-world, industry specific IoT solutions.

If you are interested in proposing a new testbed, you can send an email to iot@eclipse.org. A proposal for a new testbed should include the following details:

* Short description of the scenario
* High-level architecture
* Identified extension points
* List of interested members
* List of applicable Eclipse IoT projects

In order to lead a testbed, your company needs to be a member of [the Eclipse IoT Working Group](/working-group).
