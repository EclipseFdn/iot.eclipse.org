<p>
    The overall cost of mishandled bags to the air transport industry was US$2.4 billion in 2014 [<a href=\"http://www.sita.aero/resources/type/surveys-reports/baggage-report-2015\" target=\"blank\">SITA - Baggage Report 2015</a>].<br/>
    A key concern for shipping companies is to be able to know when and where damage is taking place so that they can, overtime, learn from this data and minimize the number of damaged parcels.
</p>
<p>
    Valuable parcels may be equipped with a removable sensor that can collect information such as temperature, humidity, or vibration levels during transit. However, the wide variety of environments that parcels go through, from planes, to airports to delivery trucks makes it particularly challenging to provide a solution that enables tracking in real-time.<br/>
    What's more, an efficient asset tracking solution needs to adapt to XXX</br>
    Finally, it might be desirable for a shipping company to not only use data collected on parcels internally (e.g to help prevent damages based on correlations found in certain datasets), but also to expose it to their customers, and raise their satisfaction level by means of providing live feedback and guarantees on how a package is being handled.
