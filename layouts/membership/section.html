          <p>
            Here are just some of the reasons why Eclipse IoT is trusted by industry leaders:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Eclipse IoT has been very successful in promoting open IoT projects and attracting new developers and
                users to IoT technologies. Our members gain adoption of their projects, which in turn helps with
                promoting their commercial products.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Eclipse Foundation’s clear, vendor-neutral rules for intellectual property sharing and
                decision-making make it easy to collaborate with other organizations on driving rapid innovation.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Foundation’s legal and intellectual property processes enable members to fully comply with
                antitrust laws and provide members with the legal assurance that they can successfully embed open
                source technology into their commercial products.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Eclipse Development Process is a set of best practices that guide member organizations during the
                creation of open source projects.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
