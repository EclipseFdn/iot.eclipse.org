    <p>The pace of IoT innovation is faster than
      ever. Open source has won because no single company can compete
      with the scale and speed of disruptive innovation delivered by
      collaborative ecosystems.</p>
    <p>
      With nearly 3.9 million lines of code across <a href="/projects">over
        35 projects</a>, supported by over 40 of the world's leading IoT
      ecosystem players, Eclipse IoT is the open source center of
      gravity for IoT.

    <p>Join global industry leaders collaborating on
      an end-to-end IoT architecture!</p>
    <h2 class="purple">A Proven Track Record</h2>
    <p>
      Here are just some of the reasons why Eclipse IoT is trusted by industry leaders:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Eclipse IoT has been very successful in promoting open IoT projects and attracting new developers and
          users to IoT technologies. Our members gain adoption of their projects, which in turn helps with
          promoting their commercial products.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Eclipse Foundation’s clear, vendor-neutral rules for intellectual property sharing and
          decision-making make it easy to collaborate with other organizations on driving rapid innovation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Foundation’s legal and intellectual property processes enable members to fully comply with
          antitrust laws and provide members with the legal assurance that they can successfully embed open
          source technology into their commercial products.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Eclipse Development Process is a set of best practices that guide member organizations during the
          creation of open source projects.
        </li>
      </ul>
