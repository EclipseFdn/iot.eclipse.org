      presenter: Mike Milinkovich
      type: 3
      abstract: |
        <p>The open source model of open collaboration and innovation is now the dominant paradigm for the creation and dissemination of new software technologies. In parallel, software is now the key driver of innovation in all sectors of society and the economy. In particular, IoT, Edge Computing, Industrie 4.0, and digital transformation are all primarily driven by software. And the winners in these sectors will be the ones who create the next generation of the platform economy: the machine economy. These trends have combined to make mastering the art of using, contributing, participating, and leading open source projects and communities critical to the future success (if not survival) of all technology-based enterprises.</p>

    - name: "Cloud Native Digital Twins"
      presenter: Jens Reimann, Dejan Bosanac
      type: 2
      abstract: |
        <p>Digital twins are a central part of most IoT solutions. They represent the physical state of the devices and provide easy to use device APIs for solution developers. Processing telemetry event streams is how devices are mapped into the digital world, so obviously this is one of the crucial topics for implementing digital twins.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of event streaming platforms available, but in this session we want to focus on cloud-native ways of doing IoT. We will explore Knative eventing concepts that provide flexible and scalable way of processing events in the cloud using different underlying messaging technologies, like Apache Kafka. Accompanied by a way to define a format of events through “Cloud Events” specifications, it provides a perfect fit for building serverless IoT integration platforms, as we’ll see on the example of Drogue Cloud project.</p>
        <p>Finally we can integrate two worlds together and demonstrate how to stream IoT telemetry data from a device through Drogue Cloud into Eclipse Ditto digital twin platform the cloud-native way.</p>

      presenter: Angelo Corsaro
      type: 1
      abstract: <p>Zenoh is rapidly growing Eclipse project that unifies data in motion, data at rest and computations. It elegantly blends traditional pub/sub with geo distributed storage, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks. This presentation will provide an introduction to Eclipse Zenoh along with a crisp explanation of the challenges that motivated the creation of this project. We will go through a series of real-world use cases that demonstrate the advantages brought by Zenoh in enabling and optimising typical edge scenarios and in simplifying the development of any scale distributed applications.</p>

      abstract: |
        <p>The Eclipse IoT Packages project has been started some two years ago with the goal of providing easy to use Helm charts that can be used to get up an running with Eclipse IoT projects easily.</p>
        <p>The Cloud2Edge package was the first package to be offered and can be used to install an IoT cloud stack consisting of Eclipse Hono, Ditto and hawkBit. During the last two years we achieved a lot but not quite everything we aimed for.</p>
        <p>During this session I will update you on the c2e package's purpose, structure, evolution and latest changes to the underlying components like Eclipse Hono, Ditto and hawkBit. If time permits we will also run a little demo illustrating how easy it is to set up the stack on a Minikube Kubernetes cluster.</p>

    - name: "Leveraging Eclipse Sparkplug to Accelerate DataOps and Machine Modeling into AWS Services"
      presenter: Arlen Nipper, Pugal Janakiraman
      type: 4
      abstract: <p>Industrial customers and solutions providers that are trying to leverage Digital Transformation to optimize production, maximize asset utilization and identify equipment maintenance issues. These customers are realizing that just sending discrete measurements into cloud data stores is not scaling. AWS realized this and understood that to make Digital Transformation easier, and have it scale across all facilities and machine types, a service was needed that could create virtual models of machines directly from edge compute technology. This session will explore how AWS and Eclipse Sparkplug are being used to automatically create machine models, assets of those models and populate the models with real-time measurements.</p>

    - name: "Extending Kubernetes to the Distributed Edge with EVE-OS"
      presenter: Jason Shepherd
      type: 1
      abstract: |
        <p>In a perfect world, we’d have one orchestration solution capable of deploying and managing infrastructure and applications spanning the entire edge continuum, however the inherent technical tradeoffs dictate necessarily different tool sets with similar principles applied. While it may be tempting to extend existing data center tools outside of the data center, they quickly start to break for reasons including being too resource-intensive, lacking an adequate zero trust security model and requiring skill sets for deployment and management that aren’t commonly found in the field.</p>
        <p>In this session, Jason will highlight the inherent differences in management and security practices across the edge continuum. He will then outline how the Project EVE community from LF Edge is collaborating with both the Eclipse Edge Native and CNCF IoT Edge Working Groups to establish EVE-OS as a universal, bare metal foundation to extend Kubernetes from the cloud to the Distributed Edge. Jason will talk through the key challenges for deploying Kubernetes in the field that EVE-OS addresses, in areas such as footprint, zero trust security, autonomy, and support for both legacy and modern workloads.</p>
