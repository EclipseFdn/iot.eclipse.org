      <description>&lt;p&gt;2lemetry is an IoT platform and solutions company that powers the connected enterprise, tying people, processes, data and devices together—transforming raw data into real-time actionable intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2lemetry&amp;rsquo;s ThingFabric platform acts as an IoT version of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) middleware solutions, providing device connectivity at scale, cross-communication, data brokering and storage. We also help companies make sense of the captured data by offering actionable data intelligence through predictive computational models and a configurable rules engine.
The ThingFabric platform has a unique protocol-agnostic architecture that enables native support of multiple protocols (like MQTT, CoAP, STOMP, and M3DA), even allowing the customer to upload their own homegrown, proprietary or legacy protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2lemetry actively contributes to the Paho project around objective-c and MQTT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bitreactive makes Reactive Blocks, a tool designed to accelerate and simplify M2M and IoT software development. Its benefits are especially well suited for applications that run autonomously on gateways. Functionality that is often used is provided by dedicated building blocks, for instance for protocols like MQTT or Modbus, access to data collection APIs or processing and buffering of data. The tool checks if applications work correctly with regard to their behavior, and detects a range of errors automatically that are hard to find by traditional testing.&lt;/p&gt;
