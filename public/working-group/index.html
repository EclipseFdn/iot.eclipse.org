                <h2 id="azul-systems">Azul Systems </h2> <p>Azul Systems is the world’s only company that is 100% focused on Java and Java runtime technology. We believe that we can help the IoT developers take advantage of the power and productivity of Java by reducing the frictions (licensing costs, field-of-use restrictions) and perceptions (footprint, etc.) gating widespread adoption of the language throughout the IoT.</p>

<p>As members of the Eclipse community we are bringing Zulu and Zulu Embedded – our 100% open source JDKs, to the IoT. Our Zulu products are certified builds of OpenJDK and meet the Java SE standards for Java 8, 7 and 6.  Each release of Zulu and Zulu Embedded has passed the thousands of tests in OpenJDK Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) as well as Azul’s extensive in-house verification suite. Zulu runs on many Linux distros, on Windows and the Mac.</p>

<p>Zulu is a complete Java Development Kit, and Zulu Enterprise provides designers with a choice of storage footprint, bitness (32 or 64-bit configurations), headless or headful, and both development and runtime-only options.</p>

Functionality that is often used is provided by dedicated building blocks, for instance for protocols like MQTT or Modbus, access to data collection APIs or processing and buffering of data. The tool checks if applications work correctly with regard to their behavior, and detects a range of errors automatically that are hard to find by traditional testing.</p>

<p><b>About Samsung ARTIK</b></p>

<p>The Samsung ARTIK end-to-end, integrated platform unifies hardware, software, cloud, security, and a partner ecosystem in a single offering. ARTIK does the heavy lifting so you can focus on differentiating your products and services. Reduce costs, time and risk.</p>

<p>Within the platform, the Samsung ARTIK Cloud provides easy-to-use, open, and enterprise-grade APIs, SDKs, and tools in a single integrated platform. Companies can use these APIs, SDKs, and tools to collect, store, and act on any data from any device or cloud service, and speed up their product development process, accelerate time to market and revenue, and improve value to customers.
We specifically focus our activities on the openHAB project, but we are also promoting the ideals of Free software in general.</p>

<p>SensorUp makes information from all different kinds of sensors accessible in a single platform, by using open standards to connect the sensors. Our IoT Platform is the world&rsquo;s first, most complete, compliant implementation of the OGC SensorThings API.</p>

<p>SensorThings API was purpose-built for IoT, and manages low power, low bandwidth, and intermittent connectivity situations. The standard isREST-based and JSON encoded,so it&rsquo;s developer friendly. Our easy-to-use APIs and SDKs can be understood and worked with in very little time.</p>

<p>Its purpose is to educate the public about the possibilities that Free software offers in the domain of smart homes.</p>

<p>More and more new technologies and devices are introduced to our living, working and business environment. Although all of them are designed to make our lives easier, they have a common problem: The lack of interoperability, due to incompatible technology stacks and conflicting commercial interests. Market consolidation and cooperation between all stakeholders therefore remains a vision. System-wide, multi-vendor interoperability can only succeed if it is free from monetary interests. Free Software is the best option to boost innovation and to make smart home technology available for everybody. Furthermore, Free Software is irreplaceable for research and teaching.</p>

<p>We specifically focus our activities on the openHAB project, but we are also promoting the ideals of Free software in general.</p>
