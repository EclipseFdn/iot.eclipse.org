    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">
        The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a significant change and opportunity for the manufacturing industry.
        Technological advancements in connectivity and communication technology, real-time data analysis, and complex event
        processing have opened the possibility of integrating the traditional operational technology (OT) of a manufacturing
        plant with the enterprise information technology (IT) systems. This alignment of OT and IT in the manufacturing industry
        presents a huge opportunity for a more efficient manufacturing process, including tighter integration of the supply
        chain, preventive maintenance of the factory floor, and more flexibility to react to changing customer demands.</p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">
        Smart Manufacturing, Industrie 4.0 or Industry 4.0 are terms often used to refer to the trend of bringing
        IoT technology to the manufacturing industry. (Note: We will be using the term “Industry 4.0” in this white paper.)
        There has been a significant amount of research and documentation on the importance and challenges of Industry 4.0.
        Key focuses for this research has been on the architecture required to bring together OT and IT in a complete system
        and the business opportunities made possible by Industry 4.0.</p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">
        The purpose of this white paper is to identify the types of software required to implement an Industry 4.0
        solution. Software is a key enabling technology for any IoT solution, including IoT in manufacturing. This white
        paper will investigate how software solutions can be used to integrate existing operational technologies on a factory
        floor with the existing enterprise applications, like PLM and ERP solutions. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">
        Finally, this white paper will identify how open source software can be used to implement Industry 4.0 solutions.
        Open source software has become a dominant provider of critical infrastructure technology for the general software
        industry. The open model of development and royalty-free distribution has proven to be an effective way to build
        production quality software. Industry 4.0 implementers can now use software from open source communities, like Eclipse
        IoT and Apache Software Foundation, to address the software requirements for production-ready Industry 4.0 solutions.</p>

    <h1 class="purple">What is Industrie 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing?</h1>
</div>
<div id="_idContainer012" class="Bloc-de-texte-standard">
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">“<a href="http://www.plattform-i40.de/I40/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html"><span class="bold---brand1">Industrie 4.0</span></a>” is a term and concept created by the German Academy of Science and Engineering; it stands for and refers to the
        integration of industrial manufacturing and information technology based on cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things
        and Cloud Computing. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Industrie 4.0 enables and supports new scenarios in manufacturing where humans, machines, production lines, software
        systems, such as MES and ERP systems, and the products themselves communicate and cooperate with each other in real
        time to enable decentralized decision making and a self-organized production. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">This approach includes all phases of the product lifecycle (product idea, development, production, usage, maintenance,
        and recycling) and all participants of the value chain (company-internal and -external, such as suppliers and customers)
        and thus allows a holistic optimization of the value chain.</p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">
        <span class="CharOverride-6">Smart Manufacturing</span> is a general term often used to reference the modernization of the manufacturing process.
        </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">The Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) has published a white paper titled “
        <a href="https://www.iiconsortium.org/pdf/Smart_Factory_Applications_in_Discrete_Mfg_white_paper_20170222.pdf">
            <span class="bold---brand1">Smart Factory Applications in Discrete Manufacturing</span>
        </a>” that documents many of the benefits of Smart Manufacturing.</p>
</div>
<div id="_idContainer013" class="Bloc-de-texte-standard">
    <h1 class="purple">Key Challenges for Implementing Industry 4.0</h1>
</div>
<div id="_idContainer014" class="Bloc-de-texte-standard">
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">There are a number of unique challenges that occur when implementing an IoT solution in the manufacturing industry. Understanding
        and addressing these challenges is important to the implementation of the solution.</p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">
        <a id="_idTextAnchor002"></a>Integration of OT and IT</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Any solution for Industry 4.0 needs to address the issues both from an OT and IT perspective. The integration of OT and
        enterprise IT technologies creates the opportunity to achieve the benefits of Industry 4.0. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">However, OT and IT have different priorities on how they adopt and manage technology. Operation technology is often focused
        on safety, efficiency, and continuity of the manufacturing process. Downtime and ‘bugs’ represent significant costs
        and disruptions to an operation. Enterprise IT is often focused on speed of execution, security of digital resources,
        and analysis of data/information. </p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Greenfield vs. Brownfield</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">The bulk of Smart Manufacturing/Industry 4.0 implementations will be into existing manufacturing operations. Existing
        operations have equipment that might not be network enabled or open to modern software technologies. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Moreover, the lifecycle of manufacturing machines may extend to 40 years which means a greenfield approach is not always
        a viable option. Different approaches might be required for
        <span class="CharOverride-7">brownfield</span> vs.
        <span class="CharOverride-7">greenfield</span> implementations.</p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Safety and Security Concerns</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Safety and security are significant concerns for the manufacturing industry. Security breaches could lead to personal
        safety issues for factory workers. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Additionally, OT and IT often have different safety and security concerns and policies that might be conflicting or create
        invisible gaps. Government regulations also influence when and how technology can be introduced into a manufacturing
        process. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Any Industry 4.0 implementation will be expected to conform to existing regulations and address the potential for security
        vulnerabilities.</p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Availability and Continuity of Services</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">For many manufacturing processes, continuous operation is of critical importance. Therefore, any additional IT services
        that are made part of a manufacturing process must be engineered for high-availability and be fault tolerant to ensure
        continuity of service.</p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Importance of Real Time</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">To meet the demands of the manufacturing processes many Industry 4.0 solutions will require real-time data and event
        processing. Delays in any data analysis or events could have adverse effects on the manufacturing process.</p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Creating a More Flexible Manufacturing Processes</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">A key driver for Industry 4.0 implementations is to create a manufacturing process that can adapt more easily to customer
        demand. Current processes are often monolithic and very cumbersome to change, so it is difficult to alter what is
        being produced by the production line. The ideal scenario is a highly flexible system that can support a production
        line that produces just one unit, sometimes called ‘‘lot size 1”.</p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">More flexible processes create a need for more distributed systems that are configurable and interoperable. This requires
        the implementations of open standards for the technical and semantic interchange of information that flows through
        the system. </p>

<div id="_idContainer020" class="Bloc-de-texte-standard">
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">The most common implementation architecture for IoT solutions has three tiers: </p>
    <ol>
        <li class="Body-Text_Special-Body-Text_Numbered-List">Constrained devices, </li>
        <li class="Body-Text_Special-Body-Text_Numbered-List">Smart devices/gateways, and </li>
        <li class="Body-Text_Special-Body-Text_Numbered-List">IoT platforms. </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">This typical architecture has been documented in <a href="/white-paper-iot-architectures" class="bold---brand1">“The Three Software Stacks Required for IoT Architectures</a>” white paper.
        Industry 4.0 implementations typically follow this general 3-tier architecture, but introduce some unique challenges
        and features for software implementations.</p>

            alt="" style="max-width: 85%; margin:0 auto;"/>


        <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Connecting Industrial IoT Devices</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">The ‘devices’ in an Industry 4.0 implementation are typically programmable logic controllers (PLC) that control the sensors
        and actuators of a machine on a factory floor. Many PLCs have limited processing capabilities and network connectivity.
        The software running on these types of PLCs is embedded in the firmware and difficult to modernize or update. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">For greenfield Industry 4.0 implementations, new modern PLCs are network enabled and can support connecting the IoT devices.
        Similarly, more advanced sensors and actuators now have the ability to directly send and receive data. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">For brownfield implementations, an IoT gateway is often introduced to aggregate the data from a group of PLCs and provide
        the data to the IT systems. Existing PLCs often implement proprietary protocols that need to be supported by gateways
        and transformed into a consistent message and data format. An IoT gateway allows to retrofit existing machines providing
        interfacing towards the field and connectivity towards the remote servers while minimizing the impact into existing
        operations.</p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Edge vs. Cloud Hosting of IoT Platform</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Due to safety, availability, security, and data privacy concerns, Industry 4.0 solutions will often require local processing
        of data at the edge versus central processing of data in the cloud. In some approaches, edge processing is provided
        at the IoT gateway. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">For instance, in predictive maintenance applications, the latency requirement, and the volume of data acquired may be
        prohibitive and edge analytics is the only viable option. In other scenarios, the deployment of an IoT platform within
        a factory or even distributed within a factory can help to ensure data aggregation at the site level, while providing
        availability and near real-time analysis of events and data. In other situations, data analysis will be dependent
        upon data aggregation performed outside of the factory, so centralized data analysis will be required. </p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Integration with Enterprise IT</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">A key aspect of an Industry 4.0 system is the integration of the OT with the enterprise IT systems. In fact, most Industry
        4.0 implementations will need to integrate with existing SCM, PLM, MES and/or ERP systems. To achieve this level
        of integration, the OT data will need to be filtered, aggregated and normalized for IT integration. Similarly, large-scale
        event processing becomes a key component to successful Enterprise IT integration.</p>

    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">The saying ‘Software is Eating the World’ is applicable to Industry 4.0 and IoT in general. Software has become a pervasive
        enabling technology in almost every industry. In Industry 4.0, software provides the flexibility to address many
        of the previous issues and enables many of the benefits derived from Industry 4.0 implementations.</p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Each Industry 4.0 implementation will have unique requirements, but there is a set of key software features that will
        be required for any successful deployment, including:</p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Data aggregation</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Being able to acquire the data from the factory floor and to perform some level of analysis is central for any Industry
        4.0 system. The data collection is typically focused on aggregating raw data from different endpoints, then filtering
        and/or processing the raw data so that it is available for real-time or batch analysis. </p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">To accomplish data aggregation and analysis the following is required:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="Body-Text_Special-Body-Text_Bullet-List">Digitalization of analog data from the factory floor and communicating this data to the network using standard protocols
            like MQTT, OPC-UA or HTTP(S). This can be accomplished via PLCs that are network enabled, or by adding IoT
            gateways that connect the PLCs to the network</li>
        <li class="Body-Text_Special-Body-Text_Bullet-List">Formatting the data using open standards, like OPC-UA, PPMP, PackML</li>
        <li class="Body-Text_Special-Body-Text_Bullet-List">Defining and sharing of semantic information to allow for easier analysis across different systems.</li>
        <li class="Body-Text_Special-Body-Text_Bullet-List">Filtering data at the edge so only relevant information is sent to the network. This can be accomplished through
            programmatic PLC or IoT gateways.</li>
        <li class="Body-Text_Special-Body-Text_Bullet-List">Data storage at the edge and in the cloud.</li>
        <li class="Body-Text_Special-Body-Text_Bullet-List">Ability to store and forward data as well as compression and schedule transfers to enable OT data will eventually
            be made available to IT and to the enterprise and data scientists for longer term analysis including training
            predictive models. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Security</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Security is a key concern for an IoT system, especially for Industry 4.0 implementations. Remote network access to factory
        equipment introduces safety and privacy concerns. Therefore, security features like device authentication, role-based
        access control, encryption of data and software updates need to be considered.</p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Device Management</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Remote device management is required for any large-scale implementation. Relying upon manual updates on the factory floor
        is prone to errors, time consuming and costly. Device management for industrial IoT devices should include initial
        setup and configuration, health check of device, software update and deactivation. </p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Event Management and Data Analysis</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Industry 4.0 implementations will generate a tremendous amount of data and events. For data management, software will
        be required to filter this data at the edge, provide real-time analytics at the edge and cloud, provide batch-oriented
        analytics and data storage. For event management, software will be required for event routing, processing and handling
        at the edge.</p>
    <h2 class="purple Titles_Headings_Heading4">Digital Twin Management</h2>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">Creating a digital representation of a physical asset is often referred to as a ‘digital twin’. Creating a digital twin
        allows for easier integration of data analysis, machine learning and monitoring that can be directly tied to the
        physical asset. Digital twins also enable simulation of future scenarios that can help with planning and preventive
        maintenance.</p>
    <p class="Body-Text_Body-Text---Justified">The software required to manage digital twins includes the tools required to create and model a twin, APIs and runtimes
        to interact with a digital twin, and administration consoles to manage the lifecycle of a digital twin collection.</p>

                    <span class="bold---brand1">Eclipse Ditto</span>
                </a> is a framework to create and manage digital twins. Ditto exposes a unified resource-based API that can be
                used to interact with devices, abstracting from the complexity of different device types and how they are
                connected. It helps to structure the devices into their distinct aspects of functionality and can optionally
                enforce data types and data validation based on a formal device meta model, based on Eclipse Vorto.</p>

                </a> provides open APIs in REST and Java, and an MQTT-based communication layer, that can be leveraged to interact
                with field devices and assets. Kura drivers provide a hardware abstraction layer that reduces the device
                interaction complexity and simplifies the communication with the devices attached to the gateway. The MQTT
                and REST APIs that Kura exposes for each device attached to a gateway allows to perform on-demand, remote,
                read and write operations, and provide a digital twin interface to those devices.</p>
