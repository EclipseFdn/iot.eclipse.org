      <description>&lt;p&gt;openHAB UG (haftungsbeschränkt) is the company behind the open-source home automation solution openHAB and believes that an open-source stack is the only right answer for home gateways. openHAB UG therefore initiated the Eclipse SmartHome project and is the lead developer behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse SmartHome project is a framework that allows building smart home solutions that have a strong focus on heterogeneous environments, i.e. solutions that deal with the integration of different protocols or standards. Its purpose is to provide a uniform access to devices and information and to facilitate different kinds of interactions with them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;dc-square is a company based in Southern Germany building software solutions for the Internet of Things. Our product HiveMQ is a MQTT broker for the enterprise, which makes it possible to connect thousands and millions of devices over wired or wireless networks with very efficient bandwidth usage and push technology. Our focus is on providing IoT building blocks for the enterprise and advice on, consult on or implement IoT solutions for companies around them. Therefore HiveMQ is build from the ground up with security, scalability and extensibility in mind. HiveMQ has an open plugin system for customizations of general behavior and permissions as well as the possibility to cluster and bridge with other instances for high availability and high scalability scenarios. All our solutions are perfectly suitable for running in the Cloud (Amazon, Azure) as well as on own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bitreactive makes Reactive Blocks, a tool designed to accelerate and simplify M2M and IoT software development. Its benefits are especially well suited for applications that run autonomously on gateways. Functionality that is often used is provided by dedicated building blocks, for instance for protocols like MQTT or Modbus, access to data collection APIs or processing and buffering of data. The tool checks if applications work correctly with regard to their behavior, and detects a range of errors automatically that are hard to find by traditional testing.&lt;/p&gt;
