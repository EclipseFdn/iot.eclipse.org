		<p>We believe that one of the biggest hurdles to create industrial
			M2M solutions is the complexity to develop the applications that are
			embedded on the communicating devices on the field.</p>
		<p>There are many domains with business opportunities for M2M
			solutions where people do not want to have to learn a complex
			language such as C, when all they want to do is manipulate a few data
			structures and send them to a remote server. What if Lua could be
			used to simplify the development of embedded applications, thus
			following the path of the mobile and game development industries?</p>


		<h2 id="what-is-lua">What is Lua?</h2>
		<div>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting
					language.</p>
				<p>Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data
					description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible
					semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode
					for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory
					management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for
					configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.</p>

		<p>Mihini is an Eclipse project created in August 2012 with the
			aim of delivering an embedded platform that:
		<ul class="unstyled">
			<li><i class="icon-ok"></i>provides low-level connectivity
				management to ensure that a reliable network connection is available
				to business applications</li>
			<li><i class="icon-ok"></i>acts as an abstraction layer for
				underlying hardware</li>
			<li><i class="icon-ok"></i>enables smart business data
				transmission between devices and servers, including the ability to
				consolidate data locally and use bandwidth-efficient communication
				protocols</li>
